// This file is intended to allow for theme extension with component shadowing.
// You can add your component imports and map them here to be used as shortcodes in MDX content.

// Import components here when needed
// import Grid from "../../../../components/Grid";
// import SpeakerCard from "../../../../components/SpeakerCard";

const shortcodes = {
  // Map your components here
  // Example:
  // Grid,
  // SpeakerCard
};

export default shortcodes;
